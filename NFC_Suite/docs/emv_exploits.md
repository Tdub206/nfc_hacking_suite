# EMV Exploitation Guide

## Introduction
This document covers **EMV payment system vulnerabilities** and how the NFC Hacking Suite can be used for research. EMV cards rely on **cryptographic protocols** for secure transactions, but several weaknesses have been identified over time.

## Attack Techniques

### 1. ARQC Replay Attack
- **Description**: The ARQC (Authorization Request Cryptogram) can be captured and replayed to initiate unauthorized transactions.  
- **How to Use**:
  1. Capture ARQC using the passive NFC sniffer.
  2. Replay the captured APDU sequence using the `/execute_apdu` endpoint.

### 2. Static Data Authentication (SDA) Cloning
- **Description**: SDA cards rely on static signatures, making them vulnerable to cloning.  
- **How to Use**:
  1. Use the `app/emv_profile.py` to simulate an SDA card response.
  2. Modify the PAN and track data to match the captured card.

## Mitigation Techniques
To secure EMV systems, consider the following:
- Upgrade to **Dynamic Data Authentication (DDA)** or **Combined DDA**.
- Use secure NFC channels with encryption.
- Regularly update terminal firmware.
